The font was inspired by Stanislaw Lem’s novels „Solaris” and „Futurological Congress” – Nounas is the site of the events of this book. The main space in which a font is supposed to find itself is technology and ambiguity. The font combines the substance in the composition of the text column, thanks to the heterogeneous thickness and specific management of the internal lights. Sharp bevels and a mesh-based structure emphasize the technical character. The substance of the gel and of the emerging objects in the Solaris Ocean is emphasized thanks to the movement of the variable font. This causes the proportions of the structure of the letters to change in width, condensing considerably.
